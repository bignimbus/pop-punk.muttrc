# ðŸŽ¸ Pop-Punk

Mutt / Neomutt theme

## Note

This theme is base16 and depends on your terminal's ANSI colors being set
to the values listed in the [AnsiColors function of pop-punk.vim](https://github.com/bignimbus/pop-punk.vim/blob/experimental/autoload/pop_punk.vim#L31-L50):

## Installation

Copy `pop-punk.muttrc` from this repository to your `~/.mutt` directory.
In `.muttrc`, add:

```sh
source ~/.mutt/pop-punk.muttrc
```

The code for this theme owes its structure to the
[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/mutt/) theme.
